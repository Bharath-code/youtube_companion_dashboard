# UX Improvements: Integrated Video Management

## Overview

We've significantly improved the user experience by integrating video editing and comment management into a unified interface, eliminating the need to switch between separate tabs and manually enter video IDs.

## Key Improvements

### ðŸŽ¯ **Unified Video Management Interface**

**Before:** Users had to:

**After:** Users can now:
- Click on any video from the video list to open the integrated manager
- Access video details, editing, and comments in one tabbed interface
- Seamlessly switch between different management tasks

### ðŸ”„ **Streamlined Navigation Flow**

1. **Browse Videos** (`/videos`) - View all your YouTube videos
2. **Click to Manage** - Single click opens the integrated manager
3. **Tabbed Interface** - Switch between Details, Edit, Comments, and Advanced settings
4. **Contextual Actions** - All actions are related to the selected video

### ðŸ“± **Improved Information Architecture**
